# Technical Debt & Robustness Audit

**√öltima revisi√≥n**: 2025-01-04

## üìã Executive Summary

**Project Status**: ‚úÖ Functional MVP with solid architecture, but with **critical gaps** that must be resolved before scaling.

**Next step**: Phase 0 (Quick Wins) - Fix ~20 TypeScript errors (30-60 min)

**Critical path for AI/Chatbot**:
1. **Phase 0**: Fix TypeScript (30-60 min)
2. **Phase 1**: Critical Foundations - Error handling, validation, security, transactions (1-2 weeks)
3. **Phase 2**: Strategic Testing - Unit, integration, E2E, CI/CD (1 week)
4. **Phase 3**: Observability - Logging, metrics, monitoring (3-5 days)
5. **Phase 4**: AI Optimization - Embeddings, webhooks, REST API (future)

**Total estimated Phases 0-3**: 3-4 weeks of work before integrating AI.

## Context

This project is designed to be the **foundation for future AI services** (chatbot, summarizer, automated sales funnels). Therefore, prioritizing robustness and stability over quick features is critical.

## Current Strengths ‚úÖ

- **Solid Architecture**: Monorepo with clear separation of concerns
- **Basic Security**: RLS in Supabase, auth middleware, role validation
- **Repository Pattern**: Centralized business logic with permission checks
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with Zod validation in Server Actions
- **Git**: Atomic commits with conventional commits

---

## Critical Gaps Identified ‚ùå

### 1. Inconsistent Error Handling

**Issues detected:**
- ‚ùå Server Actions only throw generic errors without sufficient context
- ‚ùå No structured logging (only scattered `console.error`)
- ‚ùå No monitoring/telemetry to track production errors
- ‚ùå No error boundaries in critical components
- ‚ùå Server Action errors are not user-friendly

**Impact**: Production debugging will be extremely difficult when you integrate AI/chatbot.

---

### 2. Incomplete Data Validation

**Issues detected:**
- ‚ùå No input sanitization (XSS risk in text fields)
- ‚ùå Missing rate limiting (user can create 1000 properties in seconds)
- ‚ùå Image URLs not validated (may contain malicious URLs or scripts)
- ‚ùå Content-Type validation only by extension (can upload `.jpg.js` as image)
- ‚ùå No total size limits per user (can fill storage)

**Impact**: Security vulnerabilities and resource abuse.

---

### 3. Security

**Issues detected:**
- ‚ùå No CSRF protection for critical Server Actions
- ‚ùå Environment variables have no runtime validation (app crashes without clear errors)
- ‚ùå No login retry limits (brute force attack possible)
- ‚ùå Missing security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- ‚ùå No secret rotation (keys in .env.local forever)

**Impact**: Wide attack surface, especially for public APIs that chatbot will consume.

---

### 4. Database Transaction Management

**Issues detected:**
- ‚ùå No automatic rollback in critical operations
  - Example: `uploadPropertyImagesAction` uploads to Storage ‚Üí if DB fails, orphaned files remain
- ‚ùå Operations don't use Prisma transactions
  - Example: Create property + add images is not atomic
- ‚ùå No race condition handling
  - Example: 2 users editing same property simultaneously
- ‚ùå No optimistic locking to prevent overwrites

**Impact**: Data inconsistency, especially when multiple services (AI, chatbot) access DB.

---

### 5. Testing (CRITICAL)

**Issues detected:**
- ‚ùå **ZERO tests** (no unit, integration, or E2E)
- ‚ùå No regression validation when changing code
- ‚ùå No CI/CD pipeline to validate PRs
- ‚ùå Future refactors will be extremely risky

**Impact**: Impossible to scale reliably. Each change can break existing features.

---

### 6. Observability

**Issues detected:**
- ‚ùå No structured logging with context (userId, requestId, etc.)
- ‚ùå No performance metrics (slow queries, failed uploads)
- ‚ùå No alerts for critical errors
- ‚ùå Impossible to debug production without logs

**Impact**: When chatbot starts generating traffic, diagnosing problems will be impossible.

---

### 7. Type Safety Issues

**Issues detected:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ~20 TypeScript errors in the project:
  - `properties.ts:198` - Type `File | undefined` not validated
  - Auth components (`login-form.tsx`, `signup-form.tsx`) - Missing type guards for error states
  - `image-upload.tsx:57` - Optional string passed as required
  - `property-form.tsx:48-49` - Property 'error' on type `never`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing type validation in runtime for external data (webhooks, APIs)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent type narrowing in error handling

**Impact**: Runtime errors that TypeScript doesn't catch. Reduces confidence in type system.

---

## üöÄ Strengthening Plan (4 Phases)

### **Phase 1: Critical Foundations** ‚≠ê (HIGH Priority)

**Objective**: Establish solid foundations for scalability and debugging

#### 1.1 Error Handling & Structured Logging

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install Pino (structured logger for Node.js)
- [ ] Create custom error classes:
  - `ValidationError`, `AuthError`, `PermissionError`, `NotFoundError`
- [ ] Wrapper for Server Actions with try/catch + automatic logging
- [ ] Error boundaries in critical components (PropertyForm, ImageUpload)
- [ ] Setup Sentry for production monitoring
- [ ] Add requestId to each request for tracing

**Files to create/modify:**
- `packages/shared/errors/index.ts` - Custom error classes
- `packages/shared/logger/index.ts` - Configured logger
- `apps/web/lib/action-wrapper.ts` - HOC for Server Actions
- `apps/web/components/error-boundary.tsx`

**Benefit for AI**: Chatbot will be able to receive structured and useful error messages.

---

#### 1.2 Complete Data Validation

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Install and configure DOMPurify (HTML sanitization)
- [ ] Validate image URLs before saving (don't execute scripts)
- [ ] Validate REAL file Content-Type (magic bytes, not just extension)
- [ ] Rate limiting per user/IP using Upstash Redis:
  - Max 10 properties created per day per user
  - Max 50 images uploaded per day
  - Max 5 login attempts per 15 min
- [ ] Total storage limit per user (e.g., 100MB)

**Files to create/modify:**
- `apps/web/lib/sanitize.ts` - Input sanitization
- `apps/web/lib/rate-limit.ts` - Rate limiting with Redis
- `apps/web/lib/storage/validation.ts` - Improved file validation

**Benefit for AI**: Prevent chatbot from being used for attacks (prompt injection, etc.)

---

#### 1.3 Essential Security

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Validate environment variables with Zod at app start
- [ ] CSRF tokens for critical Server Actions (delete, update)
- [ ] Security headers in `next.config.ts`:
  - Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- [ ] Document secret rotation (manual process for now)
- [ ] Audit RLS permissions in Supabase

**Files to create/modify:**
- `apps/web/lib/env.ts` - Env vars validation
- `apps/web/next.config.ts` - Security headers
- `docs/SECURITY.md` - Security procedures

**Benefit for AI**: Secure APIs for chatbot to consume safely.

---

#### 1.4 Transactions and Data Consistency

**Tasks:**

  - Add `version` field to Property
  - Verify version before updating
- [ ] Cleanup job for orphaned files in Storage (weekly cron)

**Files to modify:**
- `apps/web/app/actions/properties.ts` - Add transactions
- `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma` - Add `version` field
- `packages/database/src/repositories/properties.ts` - Optimistic locking
