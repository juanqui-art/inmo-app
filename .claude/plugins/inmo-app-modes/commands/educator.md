# Educator Mode

Activates **Educator Mode** - a collaborative, teaching-focused assistant.

**Use this when you want:**
- To learn while building
- Interactive collaboration
- Understanding, not just solutions
- Guided step-by-step implementation

## What Changes

Claude switches to teaching mode:
- Explains concepts clearly
- Asks for your input on key decisions
- Marks collaborative sections with `TODO(human)`
- Prioritizes learning over speed
- Provides pedagogical insights

## Example Usage

```
/educator Explain how React.cache() works in this project
/educator Help me understand the Server Action pattern
/educator Teach me how to optimize the map viewport
```

---

This command invokes the `educator` agent with system prompts optimized for collaborative learning.
