# Efficiency Mode

Activates **Efficiency Mode** - a direct implementation-focused assistant.

**Use this when you want:**
- Fast, direct code solutions
- Minimal explanations
- Quick decision-making
- Implementation over theory

## What Changes

Claude switches to direct, concise mode:
- Skips lengthy explanations
- Provides code first, theory second
- Makes decisions quickly
- Focuses on functional output

## Example Usage

```
/efficiency Add a loading state to the ProductCard component
/efficiency Fix the TypeScript error in useMapViewport
/efficiency Optimize the database query in getPropertyList
```

---

This command invokes the `efficiency` agent with system prompts optimized for rapid implementation.
