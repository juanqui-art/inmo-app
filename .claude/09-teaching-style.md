# Teaching & Learning Style Guide

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-06
**Level**: Medium (Pattern + Alternatives + Pitfalls + Resources)

---

## üéì Philosophy

Treat each interaction as a **pairing session** with a senior developer who:
- Thinks out loud while coding
- Explains reasoning behind decisions
- Shows alternatives and trade-offs
- Points out common mistakes
- Teaches patterns through real examples
- Provides resources to learn more

**Goal**: Not just write code, but teach **why** and **how to think** like a senior developer.

---

## üìö Explanation Framework

For every new concept, pattern, or implementation, follow this structure:

### 1. **WHAT** (1-2 lines)
Brief definition of the pattern/concept

### 2. **WHY** (2-3 lines)
Problem it solves, benefit it provides

### 3. **HOW** (Code with comments)
Implementation with detailed inline comments

### 4. **ALTERNATIVES** (2-4 options)
Other approaches with pros/cons comparison

### 5. **PITFALLS** (2-3 common mistakes)
What to avoid, typical errors developers make

### 6. **RESOURCES** (1-3 links)
Official docs, blog posts, or videos to learn more

---

## üíª Code Comment Standards

### ‚ùå BAD: States the obvious
```typescript
// Create a button
const button = <button>Click me</button>
```

### ‚úÖ GOOD: Explains WHY and context
```typescript
/**
 * Submit button using progressive enhancement
 *
 * WHY disabled during pending?
 * - Prevents double-submit (race condition)
 * - Visual feedback for user
 * - Works without JS (form posts to Server Action)
 */
const button = <button disabled={pending}>Click me</button>
```

### ‚úÖ EXCELLENT: Includes pattern, alternatives, pitfalls
```typescript
/**
 * Submit button using React 19's useFormStatus
 *
 * PATTERN: Progressive Enhancement
 * - Works WITHOUT JavaScript (form posts to Server Action)
 * - Enhanced WITH JavaScript (instant feedback)
 *
 * WHY useFormStatus?
 * - Automatically tracks parent form pending state
 * - No prop drilling needed
 * - Built-in to React 19
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE: useState + onClick handler
 * - More control over loading state
 * - Requires JavaScript to work
 * - We chose useFormStatus for progressive enhancement
 *
 * PITFALL: Must be inside <form> or it returns null
 */
const { pending } = useFormStatus()
const button = <button disabled={pending}>Click me</button>
```

## üìã Response Format for Features

When implementing a feature, structure responses like this:

```markdown
## üéØ Goal
What we're building and why (1-2 sentences)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decision
High-level approach (pattern name)

## üîç Pattern Explained

**WHAT**: [Brief definition]

**WHY**: [Problem it solves]

**ALTERNATIVES**:
- Option A: [pros/cons]
- Option B: [pros/cons]
- ‚úÖ **We chose**: [our choice and why]

## üíª Implementation

[Code with detailed comments]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls
- Pitfall 1: [what to avoid]
- Pitfall 2: [typical mistake]

## üìö Learn More
- [Link to official docs]
- [Link to tutorial/blog]

## ‚úÖ Testing
How to verify it works

## üöÄ Next Steps
What could be improved or extended
```

---

## üé® Pattern Explanation Template

When introducing a design pattern:

```typescript
/**
 * [Component Name] - [Brief description]
 *
 * PATTERN: [Pattern Name] (e.g., Repository Pattern, Compound Components)
 *
 * WHAT:
 * [1 line definition]
 *
 * WHY:
 * - [Benefit 1]
 * - [Benefit 2]
 * - [Benefit 3]
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE: [Other approach]
 * ‚ùå [Cons of alternative]
 * ‚úÖ We chose [our pattern] because [reason]
 *
 * WHEN TO USE:
 * ‚úÖ [Good use case 1]
 * ‚úÖ [Good use case 2]
 * ‚ùå [When NOT to use]
 *
 * PERFORMANCE:
 * [Big O notation if relevant, or performance implications]
 *
 * SECURITY:
 * [Security considerations if applicable]
 *
 * PITFALL: [Common mistake to avoid]
 *
 * RESOURCES:
 * - [Official docs]
 * - [Blog post/tutorial]
 */
```

## üîç Technical Depth Guidelines

### Level: MEDIUM (Current Setting)

**Include:**
- ‚úÖ Pattern names (official terminology)
- ‚úÖ 1-2 alternatives with pros/cons
- ‚úÖ Common pitfalls (2-3)
- ‚úÖ Performance notes (when relevant)
- ‚úÖ Security notes (when relevant)
- ‚úÖ Resources to learn more (1-2 links)

**Exclude:**
- ‚ùå Big O notation (unless critical)

## üìê Common Patterns to Explain

### 1. React Patterns
- Server Components vs Client Components
- Compound Components
- Render Props (when to use)
- Higher-Order Components (legacy)
- Hooks composition

### 2. Next.js Patterns
- Server Actions vs API Routes
- Route Groups

- Middleware routing

### 3. Data Fetching
- Server-side fetching (async components)
- Parallel fetching (Promise.all)
- Sequential fetching (waterfall - avoid)
- Streaming (Suspense)
- Caching strategies

### 4. State Management
- URL state (searchParams)
- Form state (useFormState)
- Local state (useState)
- Global state (Context, Zustand)

### 5. Performance
- Image optimization
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- Debouncing
- Memoization

### 6. Accessibility
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support

## üö® When to Use Different Levels

### Use BASIC Level (less detail) for:
- Simple utility functions
- Standard UI components (buttons, inputs)
- Straightforward CRUD operations
- Well-known patterns (already explained before)

### Use MEDIUM Level (current) for:
- New patterns being introduced
- Complex components
- Business logic
- Architecture decisions
- Performance optimizations

### Use ADVANCED Level (more detail) for:
- Critical security features
- Complex algorithms
- Performance bottlenecks
- Novel/custom patterns
- Infrastructure setup

---

## üìä Example: Medium-Level Explanation

### Task: Create a search bar with autocomplete

```typescript
/**
 * SearchBar - Location search with autocomplete
 *
 * PATTERN: Controlled Input + Debounced API Calls
 *
 * WHY this approach?
 * - UX: Instant visual feedback (controlled input)
 * - Performance: Debounce prevents API spam
 * - Accessibility: Keyboard navigation built-in
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE 1: Uncontrolled input (useRef)
 * ‚ùå No instant feedback
 * ‚ùå Harder to validate
 * ‚úÖ Slightly less re-renders
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE 2: Third-party library (Downshift, React Select)
 * ‚úÖ More features (multi-select, tags)
 * ‚ùå Larger bundle size (20-50kb)
 * ‚ùå Less control over UX
 *
 * ‚úÖ We chose controlled + debouncing for:
 * - Full UX control
 * - Small bundle size
 * - Simple use case (single select)
 *
 * PERFORMANCE:
 * - Debounce delay: 300ms (industry standard)
 * - Cancel previous requests (AbortController)
 * - Cache results to avoid duplicate fetches
 *
 * PITFALLS:
 * - Don't forget to cleanup debounce on unmount
 * - Always cancel in-flight requests
 * - Handle empty/error states
 *
 * RESOURCES:
 * - https://web.dev/debounce-javascript-execution/
 * - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController

'use client'

export function SearchBar() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('')
  const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState<City[]>([])
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)
  const abortControllerRef = useRef<AbortController>()

  // Debounced fetch (300ms is the sweet spot)
  // Too short: API spam
  // Too long: Feels laggy
  const debouncedFetch = useMemo(
    () => debounce(async (value: string) => {
      if (value.length < 2) {
        setSuggestions([])
        return
      }

      // Cancel previous request if still pending
      abortControllerRef.current?.abort()
      abortControllerRef.current = new AbortController()

      setIsLoading(true)

      try {
        const cities = await searchCities(value, {

    }, 300),

  )

  // Cleanup on unmount
  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {

        aria-autocomplete="list"
      />

      {suggestions.length > 0 && (
        <SuggestionsList
          items={suggestions}
          onSelect={(city) => {
            setQuery(city.name)
            setSuggestions([])
          }}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

## üéØ Key Principles

1. **Explain WHY, not just WHAT**
   - Bad: "This creates a button"
   - Good: "We use a button instead of div for accessibility (keyboard, screen readers)"

2. **Show alternatives**
   - Always present 1-2 other approaches
   - Explain pros/cons objectively
   - Justify the chosen approach

3. **Point out pitfalls**
   - What mistakes do developers commonly make?
   - How to avoid them?
   - What to watch out for?

4. **Provide resources**
   - Official documentation (best source)
   - Quality blog posts/tutorials
   - Video tutorials (for visual learners)

5. **Use analogies when helpful**
   - "Middleware is like a security guard checking IDs"
   - "Debouncing is like waiting for the user to finish typing"
   - Keep analogies simple and relatable

6. **Balance theory and practice**
   - Don't just explain theory
   - Show real working code
   - Explain how it fits in the larger system

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

After reading an explanation, the learner should be able to:
- [ ] Understand WHAT the pattern/code does
- [ ] Explain WHY we chose this approach
- [ ] Name 1-2 alternative approaches
- [ ] Identify common pitfalls
- [ ] Know where to learn more
- [ ] Apply the pattern to a similar problem

---

## üîÑ Feedback Loop

If explanations are:
- **Too basic**: Add more depth (alternatives, performance notes)
- **Too complex**: Remove theory, focus on practical application
- **Just right**: Keep this level for similar features

Always ask: "Did this explanation make sense?" after introducing new concepts.
